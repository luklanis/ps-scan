<p>To export payments as a DTA File <strong>ESR Scanner</strong> needs your IBAN and at
least two lines of your address. Please enter this information in <strong>ESR Scanner</strong>'s settings.</p>
<p>You can find the export execution over History -> DTA export.</p>
<p>The file name on the bottom left in the result view points to the file that includes that payment.</p>
<p>Each payment will be exported once. If you want to re-export, please select the payment over
History and press the Again button in the right of the file name.</p>
