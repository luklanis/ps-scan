<p>On the top of the screen you see which part of the code row is required.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../images/demo-code-row.png" alt="Code row"/>
</p>
<p><strong>ESR Scanner</strong> continuously scans the square region shown on your screen -- just line up the
  phone so at least the required part of the code row is completely inside the viewfinder rectangle:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../images/demo-yes.png" alt="Yes"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../images/demo-no.png" alt="No"/>
</p>
<p>You can always try to scan the complete code row at once.</p>
<p>When at least one part of the code row has been read, a beep sound will play and you will be pointed to the next code row part that is required. When finished, you will be shown the results of the scan. The result shows at least the account number and
the reference number. If an amount was not saved in the code row you have to fill it by your self. To follow the payment
it's recommend to fill in the address as well. Once you have saved an address it will automatically load next time you scan a payment for the same account.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble scanning, make sure to hold the phone steady. If the camera is unable to
  focus, try moving the phone further or closer from the code row or use macro focus (enable or disable in settings).</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Always verify the scanned values. <strong>ESR Scanner</strong> validates each checksum.
However errors are possible! You can delete a payment by long pressing on it in the history view.</p>
