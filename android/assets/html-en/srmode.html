<p>In this mode <strong>ESR Scanner</strong> works like a payment slip reader (ex. <a href="http://www.paypen.ch">paypen</a>). 
Simply scan your payment and the code row will be sent (over wifi) to your computer.</p>

<strong>How to use</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Download and install ESRReceiver (currently for Windows only) from 
  	<a href="http://www.wuala.com/gulb/open/ESRReceiver/ESRReceiver.msi"> on your pc
  	http://www.wuala.com/gulb/open/ESRReceiver/ESRReceiver.msi</a></li>
  <li>Enable wifi on your mobile</li>
  <li>Start ESRScanner and got to Settings</li>
  <li>Check "Enable slip-reader mode" and go back</li>
  <li>Fill in the showed (on the bottom right corner) ip address on ESRReceiver and press "Connect"</li>
  <li>Place the cursor on your computer where the code row should be placed</li>
  <li>Scan your code</li> 
</ol>

<p>If you have slip-reader mode enabled, you can't go to a detail of a payment. Instead you can re-send
the code row if you select it in the history view.</p>
