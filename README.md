#esr-scanner
* * *

An experimental app for Android that reads the code row of an orange (swiss) payment slip using the device camera.

Runs the Tesseract 3.01 OCR engine using a fork of Tesseract Tools for Android.

Most of the code making up the core structure of this project has been adapted from android-ocr (Thanks to Robert Theis). Along with Tesseract-OCR and Tesseract Tools for Android (tesseract-android-tools), several open source projects have been used in this project, including jtar.

## Requires

* Installation of [tess-two](https://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two) as a library project, to act as the OCR engine.
* Installation of [ActionBarSherlock](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock) as a library project.
